- **Current Deliverable:** Infrastructure-as-code repository structure and implementation strategy for Open edX deployment.
- **Completed:** 
    - Initial project understanding by reading architecture documents (`project_architecture.md`, `checking_protocol.md`, `error_prevention_mechanism.md`).
    - Proposed and received approval for ADR-001 (Repository Structure) and ADR-002 (Tutor for Open edX).
    - Created the core repository directory structure as per ADR-001.
    - Created `docs/adr/ADR-001-repository-structure.md`.
    - Created `docs/adr/ADR-002-tutor-for-openedx.md`.
    - Created initial `README.md`.
    - Completed setup for a GitHub Codespaces development environment.
- **In Progress:** Preparing for Open edX containerization setup using Tutor.
    - **Tutor Prerequisites Identified (2025-05-11):**
        - OS: 64-bit UNIX-based (or Windows with WSL 2).
        - Architecture: AMD64 or ARM64.
        - Software: Docker v24.0.5+ (with BuildKit 0.11+), Docker Compose v2.0.0+.
        - Python: Python 3.8+ (for Tutor installation via pip).
        - Ports: 80 and 443 open.
        - Hardware (Min): 4 GB RAM, 2 CPU, 8 GB disk.
        - Hardware (Rec): 8 GB RAM, 4 CPU, 25 GB disk.
    - **Environment Verification (2025-05-11):**
        - Python 3.12.6 ✓ (verified)
        - pip 25.1.1 ✓ (verified)
        - Docker ✗ (blocked - admin privileges required)
        - Docker Compose ✗ (blocked - admin privileges required)
    - **Implementation Challenge (2025-05-11):**
        - Docker installation requires admin privileges, which are not available in the current environment.
        - Research indicates most Open edX deployment methods rely on Docker/Tutor.
        - Need to evaluate alternative approaches that align with our project goals without requiring admin access.
- **Next:** 
    1. Test the cloud environment setup with basic Tutor commands.
    2. Proceed with further Open edX development and customization within the Codespace.

- **Research Findings (2025-05-11):**
    - Completed research on development environment options without admin privileges.
    - Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/research/development_environment_options.md`.
    - **Key Recommendations:**
        - **Primary Option:** GitHub Codespaces - Provides Docker capabilities in the cloud with seamless GitHub integration.
        - **Alternative:** Gitpod - Open-source option with similar capabilities and multi-repository support.
        - **Implementation Approach:** Create configuration files (devcontainer.json) that include Docker, Docker Compose, and Tutor prerequisites.

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR):
- **ADR-001 (Approved):** Standardized repository structure for IaC, CI/CD, K8s/Terraform configs, source code, and docs. Implemented on 2025-05-11.
- **ADR-002 (Approved):** Use Tutor for Open edX containerization (Docker locally, Kubernetes for production) to manage Open edX services, themes, and plugins. Approved on 2025-05-11.
- **ADR-003 (Proposed):** Non-Docker Implementation Strategy for Open edX - Outlines alternative approaches given the admin access limitations for Docker installation. Created on 2025-05-11.

## 2025-05-12: Testing GitHub Codespaces Environment & Open edX Initialization

**Phase:** System Foundation
**Overall Progress:** 18% (Estimated)

**Summary:**
Successfully tested the GitHub Codespaces development environment and initialized an Open edX instance using Tutor. This confirms our cloud-based approach is viable and provides a working development platform without requiring local admin rights.

**Key Activities:**

1. **Repository Setup:**
   * Initialized a Git repository for the `open_source_lms` project.
   * Committed all configuration files (`.devcontainer/*`, `README.md`, etc.).
   * Created a GitHub repository and pushed the code.

2. **Codespace Launch & Verification:**
   * Successfully launched a new Codespace from the GitHub repository.
   * Identified and resolved issues with the Tutor virtual environment:
     * The `postCreateCommand` created the `~/tutor_venv` directory but encountered permission issues.
     * Manually installed Tutor globally as a workaround, which proved successful.

3. **Open edX Initialization:**
   * Identified the correct initialization command for Tutor v19.0.2: `tutor local launch` (replacing the deprecated `quickstart` command).
   * Fixed permission issues with the Tutor configuration directory.
   * Successfully ran `tutor local launch` which:
     * Prompted for and saved configuration options.
     * Downloaded and built all necessary Docker images.
     * Started the Open edX platform with all services.

4. **Platform Verification:**
   * Confirmed the Open edX platform is running with the following services accessible:
     * LMS (Learning Management System): http://local.openedx.io
     * Studio (Content Management System): http://studio.local.openedx.io
     * Meilisearch: http://meilisearch.local.openedx.io
     * Apps: http://apps.local.openedx.io

**Challenges & Resolutions:**
* **Virtual Environment Issues:** The initial `postCreateCommand` couldn't properly create and populate the Tutor virtual environment due to permission issues. Resolved by installing Tutor globally, which works for our development purposes.
* **Command Changes:** Discovered that Tutor v19.0.2 has replaced the `quickstart` command with `launch`. Updated our approach accordingly.
* **Permission Issues:** Encountered permission problems with the Tutor configuration directory. Resolved by manually creating and setting proper ownership of the directory.

**Next Steps:**
1. Configure port forwarding in the Codespace to access the Open edX services from our local browser.
2. Explore the Open edX platform and verify all functionality is working correctly.
3. Begin planning for customizations and extensions to meet our specific requirements.
4. Update documentation with lessons learned and improved setup instructions.

**Blockers:**
* None currently. All previous technical issues have been resolved.

## 2025-05-11: GitHub Codespaces Environment Setup

**Phase:** System Foundation
**Overall Progress:** 15% (Estimated)

**Summary:**
Completed the setup for a GitHub Codespaces development environment. This provides a cloud-based solution that circumvents the local admin rights issue for Docker installation, enabling Tutor-based Open edX development.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **`.devcontainer` Configuration:**
    *   Created `open_source_lms/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: Main configuration file defining the Codespace, including Docker-in-Docker, Python 3.10, port forwarding, and VS Code customizations.
    *   Created `open_source_lms/.devcontainer/Dockerfile`: Defines the base Ubuntu image with necessary tools like `jq`, `python3-pip`, and `python3-venv`.
    *   Created `open_source_lms/.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`: Configures the `app` service for the development environment, utilizing the Dockerfile and mounting project/Tutor volumes.
2.  **Automated Tutor Installation:**
    *   The `postCreateCommand` in `devcontainer.json` was configured to:
        *   Install `python3-virtualenv` and `jq`.
        *   Create a Python virtual environment at `~/tutor_venv`.
        *   Install the latest version of `tutor[full]` into this venv.
        *   Configure `.bashrc` to auto-activate the venv and provide helpful startup messages, including the command for `tutor local quickstart`.
3.  **Documentation:**
    *   Added a detailed section "Development with GitHub Codespaces" to `open_source_lms/README.md`. This section covers launching the Codespace, the automatic setup process, first-time Open edX initialization with `tutor local quickstart`, accessing LMS/Studio, subsequent start/stop commands, and troubleshooting tips.

**Challenges & Resolutions:**
*   Initial attempts to provide all file content for manual creation were cumbersome for the USER. Switched to creating/editing files sequentially using AI tools, which was more manageable.
*   Ensured `devcontainer.json` and its `postCreateCommand` were robust and correctly formatted for JSON, including fetching the latest Tutor version dynamically.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Commit all new and modified files (`.devcontainer/*`, `README.md`, `development_journal.md`, `sequential_thinking_log.md`) to the repository.
2.  Push the changes to GitHub.
3.  Thoroughly test the GitHub Codespaces environment by:
    *   Launching a new Codespace from the `main` branch.
    *   Verifying the `postCreateCommand` completes successfully and Tutor is installed.
    *   Running `tutor local quickstart` and ensuring Open edX starts correctly.
    *   Accessing the LMS and Studio via the forwarded ports.
4.  Proceed with further Open edX development and customization within the Codespace.

**Blockers:**
*   None currently. The primary blocker of local admin rights for Docker has been addressed by adopting GitHub Codespaces.
