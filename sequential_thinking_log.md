**USER REQUEST:** INITIALIZE_PROJECT in workspace open_source_lms. read the files inside the folder. Follow the White-Label LMS Architecture Blueprint with these execution parameters: Strict adherence to the system architecture (0-100%) as documented, Implementation of all core principles from the .md specification, Application of the Architecture Compliance System for error prevention, Mandatory checkpointing at each 10% milestone, Begin with System Foundation (0-20%) components, Maintain development journal with current position markers, Report architecture decisions for explicit approval, Follow token management strategy to ensure completion, Support VERIFY:[component] command for compliance checks. First deliverable: Infrastructure-as-code repository structure and containerization setup for Open edX deployment.

**Step 0 (Previous):** None (This is the first step for this specific request).
**Step 1 (Completed):** Created `sequential_thinking_log.md`. Listed files in `open_source_lms` directory.
**Step 2 (Completed):** Viewed `project_architecture.md`. Key takeaways: Open edX, Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
**Step 3 (Completed):** Viewed `checking_protocol.md`. Key takeaways: `VERIFY:[component]` command, recursive validation.
**Step 4 (Completed):** Viewed `error_prevention_mechanism.md`. Key takeaways: Development journal, checkpoints, approval for architecture decisions.
**Step 5 (Completed):** Created `development_journal.md`. Proposed repository structure (ADR-001) and Open edX containerization strategy (ADR-002).
**Step 6 (Completed):** Updated `development_journal.md` with proposals. Awaited and received USER approval for ADR-001 and ADR-002.

    - 8.3: Verify Python and pip installation (COMPLETED - Python 3.12.6 and pip 25.1.1 are installed).
    - 8.4: Attempt Docker installation (BLOCKED - Admin access required for Docker Desktop on Windows).
    - 8.5: Research alternatives to Docker-based Open edX deployment (COMPLETED).
    - 8.6: Evaluate architectural options given the system constraints (COMPLETED).
    - 8.7: Create ADR-003 documenting the revised approach (COMPLETED).
    - 8.8: Update `development_journal.md` to reflect the revised strategy (COMPLETED).

**Step 9: Research Portable Vagrant and Cloud-Based Development Options**

    - 9.3: Research cloud-based development environments (GitHub Codespaces, GitPod, etc.) (COMPLETED).
    - 9.4: Document findings and recommendations in `docs/research/development_environment_options.md` (COMPLETED).
    - 9.5: Update `development_journal.md` with findings (COMPLETED).

**Step 10: Create GitHub Codespaces Configuration for Open edX Development**
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:**
  - **10.1:** Research GitHub Codespaces `devcontainer.json` options for Docker, Python, and Tutor. (Completed)
  - **10.2:** Create `.devcontainer` directory in `open_source_lms` project root. (Completed)
  - **10.3:** Create `devcontainer.json` file to define the development environment (Docker, Docker Compose, Python). (Completed)
  - **10.4:** Create Dockerfile for the development container (used by `devcontainer.json`). (Completed)
  - **10.5:** Add Tutor installation and initial configuration to `postCreateCommand` in `devcontainer.json`. (Completed)
  - **10.6:** Document usage instructions in `open_source_lms/README.md`. (Completed)
  - **10.7:** Update `development_journal.md`. (Completed)

**Step 11: Test GitHub Codespaces Environment**
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:**
  - **11.1:** Commit all new and modified files to the repository. (Completed)
  - **11.2:** Push changes to GitHub. (Completed)
  - **11.3:** Launch a new Codespace from the `main` branch. (Completed)
  - **11.4:** Verify `postCreateCommand` completes successfully and Tutor is installed. (Completed - Tutor installed globally due to venv issues; venv issue noted for later review)
  - **11.5:** Run Open edX initialization commands. (Completed - Successfully ran `tutor local launch` after fixing permission issues)
  - **11.6:** Access LMS and Studio. (In Progress - Platform accessible at the following URLs in the Codespace:

**Step 12: Plan Open edX Customization and White-Labeling**
- **Status:** Pending
- **Details:**
  - **12.1:** Commit latest documentation updates to GitHub. (In Progress)
    - Sequential Thinking: We need to commit our updated documentation files (README.md, development_journal.md, sequential_thinking_log.md) to preserve our progress and lessons learned during the GitHub Codespaces testing. This ensures all team members have access to accurate setup instructions and troubleshooting tips.
